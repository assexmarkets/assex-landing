            The Trading Contest is a time-bound, high-energy competition where
            traders go head-to-head on a live leaderboard by executing real
            trades in the market. It’s more than just a challenge — it’s an
            opportunity to showcase your trading skills, test your strategies
            under pressure, and rise through the ranks in a competitive yet
            rewarding environment.
            {"\n\n"}Participants are ranked based on key performance metrics
            such as profitability, risk management, and trade volume. Whether
            you&apos;re aiming for the top spot or simply want to sharpen your
            skills, every trade counts.
            {"\n\n"}As you climb the leaderboard, you stand a chance to win cash
            prizes, trading bonuses, and exclusive platform perks like reduced
            spreads, VIP account access, or personal strategy consultations with
            top analysts.
