            Metals trading involves buying and selling different metals like
            gold, silver, copper, platinum, and more within financial markets.
            {"\n\n"}These metals are traded as commodities on global exchanges,
            with their prices affected by factors such as supply and demand,
            geopolitical developments, and economic trends.
            {"\n\n"}Trading metals can occur in various ways, including physical
            trading where the actual metal is delivered, or through Contracts
            for Difference (CFDs), which offer the advantage of leverage.
            {"\n\n"}At Assexmarkets, you can trade metal CFDs with leverage,
            allowing you to increase your position size and potentially enhance
            your trading opportunities.
